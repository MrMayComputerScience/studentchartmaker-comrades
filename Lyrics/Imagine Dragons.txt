[Thunder]
Just a young gun
With a quick fuse
I was uptight
Wanna let loose
I was dreaming
Of bigger things and
wanna leave my old life behind
not a yes sir
not a follower
fit the box
fit the mold
have a seat
in the foyer
take a number
I was lightning
before the thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
lightning and the thunder
thunder feel the thunder
ligthning and the thunder

Kids were laughing
in my classes
while I was scheming
for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreamin bout being a big star
Say you're basic
Say you're easy
You're always riding
In the backseat
Now im smiling
from the stage while
you are clappin
from the nose bleed

Thunder, feel the thunder
lightning and the thunder
thunder feel the thunder
lightning and the thunder

oooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooo
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
thunder feel the thunder
lightning and the thunder
thunder feel the thunder
lightning and the thunder

[Believer]
First things first
I will say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been
oo OOOOOOO oo
The way that things have been
oo OOOOOOO oo
Second things second
Dont you tell me what you think that I can be
Im the one at the sails Im the master of my seas
oo OOOOOOO oo
The master of my seas
oo OOOOOOO oo
I was broken from a young age
taken my sould into the masses
write down my poems for the few
that look to me
took to me
shook to me
feelin me
singing from heartache
from the pain
taken my message from the vein
singing my lesson from my brain
seeing the beauty throuh the

PAIN
You made me a you made me a
Believer, believer
PAIN
You break me down you build me up
Believer, believer
PAIN
I let the bullets fly oh let the rain
my life my love my god they came from
PAIN
You made me you made me a
Believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've earned has turned your spirit to a dove
oo OOOOOOO oo
You're spirit up above
oo OOOOOOO oo

I was choking in the crowd
Living my brain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feeling they would drown
But they never did ever lived
Ebbing and flowing
Inhibited limited
Til it broke up and it rained down
It rained down like

PAIN
You made me a you made me a
Believer, believer
PAIN
You break me down you build me up
Believer, believer
PAIN
I let the bullets fly oh let them rain
My life my love my god they came from
PAIN
You made me a you made me a
Believer, believer

Last things last
by the grace of the fire and the flam
your the face of the future
the blood in my veins
oo OOOOOOO oo
the bloOOod in my veins
oo OOOOOOO oo
But they never did ever lived
Ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited
til it broke up and it rained down
it rained down like

PAIN
You made me a you made me a
Believer, believer
PAIN
You break me down you build me up
Believer, believer
PAIN
I let the bullets fly oh let them rain
My life my love my god they came from
PAIN
You made me a you made me a
Believer, believer
