[Somebody Told Me]
Breaking my back just to know your name
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breaking my back just to know your name
But heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes but don't blink you might miss
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential

Ready? Let's roll onto something new
Taking its toll and I'm leaving without you
I'm ready, let's roll onto something new

'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential
A rushin', a rushin' around

Pace yourself for me
I said maybe baby please
But I just don't know now
When all I wanna do is try

[Mr. Brightside]
I'm coming out of my cage
And I've been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke
And she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head
But she's touching his chest
Now, he takes off her dress
Now, let me go

And I just can't look - it's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Turning through sick lullabies [acoustic version of the song says: "Swimming through sick lullabies"]
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
‘Cause I'm Mr Brightside

I never...
I never...
I never...
I never...

[The Man]
I know the score like the back of my hand
Them other boys, I don't give a damn
They kiss on the ring, I carry the crown
Nothing can break, nothing can break me down
Don't need no advice, I got a plan
I know the direction, the lay of the land
I know the score like the back of my hand
Them other boys, I don't give a damn

I'm the man, come round
No-no-nothing can break, no-nothing can break me down
I'm the man, come round and
No-no-nothing can break, you can't break me down

I got gas in the tank
I got money in the bank
I got news for you baby, you're looking at the man
I got skin in the game
I got a household name
I got news for you baby, you're looking at the man

When it comes to Friday, I always earn
Don't try to teach me, I got nothing to learn
'Cause baby I'm gifted
You see what I mean?
USDA certified lean

I'm the man, come round
No-no-nothing can break, you can't break me down

I got gas in the tank
I got money in the bank
I got news for you baby, you're looking at the man
I got skin in the game
I don't feel no pain
I got news for you baby, you're looking at the man

Who's the man? Who's the man?
I'm the man, I'm the man
Who's the man with the plan?
I'm the man

Who's the man? Who's the man?
I'm the man, I'm the man
Who's the man with the plan?
I'm the man

I'm the man
I'm the man

I got gas in the tank
I got money in the bank
I got news for you baby, you're looking at the man
I got skin in the game
Headed to the hall of fame
I got news for you baby, you're looking at the man

Right hand to God
First in command
My testimony, but I take the stand

Who's the man? Who's the man?
I'm the man, I'm the man
Who's the man with the plan?
I'm the man

Who's the man? Who's the man?
I'm the man, I'm the man
Who's the man with the plan?
I'm the man

I don't give a damn
I'm the man
