[Feel it Still]
I keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust them off put em back up on the shelf
Incase my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooo woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I've been feelin it since 1966 now
Might be over now but I feel it still

Ooo woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like its 1986 now
Might be over now but I feel it still

Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with the baby sitter momma call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooo woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I've been feelin it since 1966 now
might be over now but you feel it still

Ooo woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like its 1986 now
Might've had your fill but you feel it still

We can fight a war for peace
Give in to that easy livin
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flippin for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come in
Its time to give a little to the kids in the middle
but oh until it falls dont bother me

Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

Ooo woo im a rebel just for kicks now
your love is an abyss for me heart to eclipse now
Might be over now but I feel it still

Ooo woo im a rebel just for kicks now
I've been feelin it since 1966 now
Might be over now but I feel it stil

Ooo woo im a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like its 1986 now
Might of had your fill but you feel it still
Might be over now but you feel it still

[Keep on]
Keep on hangin' on
Stuck here 'til I'm gone
Boys still throwin' stones
Runnin' till I'm wrong

I never listened
To tell the truth
I never knew
But nobody misses
What you did
Quite like I do

Got me thinkin' 'bout it
All day long
All day long

Bangin' my head against the wall
All day long
Bangin' my head against the wall
Dead and gone

But I'm seein' a pattern
Fallin' from a ladder
Must be trippin' like a cartoon
Slippin' on a banana

Looked up in the sun
Burned out but I ain't done
Ice cream meltin' down
Drippin' on the ground

Young black and gifted
Never lose, gotta be the shoes
That old money privilege
Got me confused
What is it you do?

Got me thinking 'bout it
All day long
Bangin' my head against the wall
All day long
Bangin' my head against the wall
All day long
Bangin' my head against the wall
All day long
And it's all and it's all and it's all day long
'Til we're dead and gone

Maybe I'm trippin' to tell the truth
Don't have a clue
(Maybe you're not alone, that's right)
Maybe I missed out on my youth
Playing it cool
Man in the mirror like
Grow up, be a winner
Blow up, be a winner

All day long, 'til we're dead and gone
Be a winner
All day long, 'til we're dead and gone
Grow up, be a winner
All day long, 'til we're dead and gone
Bangin' my head against the wall
All day long
And it's all and it's all and it's all day long
Bangin' my head against the wall
'Til we're dead and gone
And it's all day long 'til we're dead and gone
Bangin' my head against the wall

[Easy Tiger]
Good kid, bad brains
Livin' for whatever
Tight rope, no chains
Holdin' it together

But it's hard to see clouds
When you're 6 feet underground
Keep building a house
Then tearing it down

And it goes on

Don't call collect
Can't break it open
Easy Tiger
You're only 16 going on forever
Take it Easy Tiger
Don't call collect
Can't break it open
Easy Tiger
Only 16 going on forever
Easy Tiger
You're only 16 going on forever

No rain, clear skies
At least I got the weather
Bought in, sold out
Finger up to heaven

Cause I still see your face
Getting lost in the crowd
And I still hear the sound
Of the pack when they howl

And it goes on

Don't call collect
Can't break it open
Easy Tiger
You're only 16 going on Forever
Take it Easy Tiger
Don't call collect
Can't break it open
Easy Tiger
Only 16 going on Forever
Easy Tiger
You're only 16 going on Forever

Gasping for air I'm chokin'
Running with no sign of slowin'
Till my legs are broken
Easy Tiger
Gasping for air I'm chokin'
Running with no sign of slowin'

Don't call collect
Can't break it open
Easy Tiger
You're only 16 going on Forever
Take it Easy Tiger
Easy Tiger
You're only 16 going on Forever

[John Gourley:]
Hello, I'm, hello, I'm, hello, I'm
Hello, I'm introducing
Hello, I'm introducing
Live leak the revolution
Go stream it now on demand
New world distribution
Let's make low resolutions
Let's reverse evolution
Let's leave behind this dry land
Crawl back to the ocean

[Zoe Manville:]
Act like you're over it, still be upset
Naturally gifted or losing it
Act like you're over it, still be upset
Naturally gifted, down for heavy lifting

[John Gourley:]
I know my rights, je t'aime Paris
Live or die like c'est la vie
With my fist in the air, "Je suis Charlie"
Can't ya see I'm feeling magnifique?

[Zoe Manville:]
So down, is there no hope?
I can't believe in no one
So down, is there no hope?
I can't believe in no one

[John Gourley:]
Out for me, out for me, out for me, out for me
They got it out for me, out for me, out for me, out for me

Broke out the institution
Got lost in the confusion
Not mad, man, I'm a big fan
I love that noise pollution
It's in my constitution
Forever disillusioned
So, go on, keep on talking
Y'all can't take my bullshit
Can't take my bullshit
Can't take my bullshit

Act like you're over it, still be upset
Naturally gifted, down for heavy lifting

I know my rights, je t'aime Paris
Live or die like c'est la vie
With my fist in the air, "Je suis Charlie"
Can't ya see I'm feeling magnifique?

[Zoe Manville (Mary Elizabeth Winstead):]
So down, is there no hope? (C'est la vie)
I can't believe in no one (I'm still feeling magnifique)
So down, is there no hope?
I can't believe in no one

[Mary Elizabeth Winstead:]
Tu cries, tu souffres, et tu souris
Tu broies du noir, et tu rougis
Tu cries, tu souffres, et tu souris
Tu broies du noir et tu serais

[John Gourley:]
I know my rights, je t'aime Paris
Live or die like c'est la vie
With my fist in the air, "Je suis Charlie"
Can't ya see I'm feeling magnifique?

I know my rights, je t'aime Paris
Live or die like c'est la vie
Even when the world has it out for me
I'm still feeling magnifique

[Zoe Manville (John Gourley):]
So down, is there no hope?
I can't believe in no one
So down, is there no hope? (C'est la vie)
I can't believe in no one (Magnifique)
So down, is there no hope?
I can't believe in no one

[Tidal Wave]
I can see it in your eyes
See it in your face
Banging on your chest
Acting tough looking unfazed
Tripping over landlines
Cutting deep with a dull blade
Running out of unrest
Goin' out of your mind

Lonely days will follow, days will follow
And the gaze that stuck the halls will know your name

Hit me like a tidal wave (ooooh)
Triggered by the aftershock
Hit me like a tidal wave (ooooh)
Triggered by the aftershock
(Oooooh, oooooh, oooooooooh)
Hit me like a tidal wave (ooooh)
Triggered by the aftershock
(Aftershock)
(That aftershock)
(Triggered by the aftershock)

I can see it with my own eyes
The tracks down your face
It can't be easy tryna unwind
Sleepin' on your day dreams
I'm not tryna role play
I keep thinkin' break us take the wheel
These days can break
But I'm gonna take the wheel

Hit me like a tidal wave (ooooh)
Triggered by the aftershock
Hit me like a tidal wave (ooooh)
Triggered by the aftershock
(Oooooh, oooooh, oooooooooh)
Hit me like a tidal wave (ooooh)
Triggered by the aftershock
(Aftershock)
(That aftershock)
(Triggered by the aftershock)

Bet on the winners
Worst of you's born to lose
Bed with no dinner
The rest of you's born to lose
Better than zero
Worst of you's born to lose
Bet on the winners

Hit me like a tidal wave (ooooh)
Triggered by the aftershock
Hit me like a tidal wave (ooooh)
Triggered by the aftershock
(Oooooh, oooooh, oooooooooh)
Hit me like a tidal wave (ooooh)
Triggered by the aftershock
(Aftershock)
(That aftershock)
(Aftershock)
